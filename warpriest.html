<h2 id="fervor">Fervor</h2>
<p>You have 7?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Fervors per day. You can use these to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>heal someone for 2d6 (if it's you, it's swift, else it's a standard action);</li>
<li>slap an undead for 2d6 (standard);</li>
<li>cast any spell that doesn't take multiple rounds as a swift action, as long as it only targets you.
This seems like it's intended to let you get buffs up and be really strong while also attacking</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-note-on-spells">A Note on Spells</h2>
<p>You will be preparing spells to spell slots - that is, you pick which spells and how many of them you'll be able to cast that day at the start of the day. You have lots of flexibility at the beginning of the day though- you can prepare <em>any</em> cleric spell of your level.</p>
<p>HOWEVER: at any point, you can take a prepared spell you have, and turn it into a Cure spell of the same level or lower, so you'll always have some healing.</p>
<p>You appear to be a 'half-caster' meaning that your spell levels progress slower than full casters, but in exchange you have better martial capabilities - I assume you want to kanata people.
It looks like your plan is to get in, swift-cast bull's strength on yourself, and beat the shit out of people.</p>
<h3 id="if-sommon-meant-summon">If sommon meant summon:</h3>
<p>You <em>could</em> use summons, but those tend to have long cast times and you can't use <a href="#fervor">Fervor</a> to cheat on the cast time.</p>
<h3 id="if-sommon-meant-common">If sommon meant common:</h3>
<p>See the note about converting prepared spells into Cure spells. I'm not sure what spells are good for you, but Bull's Strength is good. You might want to look into a staff to be able to bank spells per day (ish).</p>
<h2 id="segue-into-sacred-weapon">Segue into Sacred Weapon</h2>
<p>For 7<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> rounds per day, you can make your kanata do cool things. First, and less impressively, you can change it to do 1d8 of damage. This doesn't do anything <em>right now</em> but at level 10 it will change to 1d10, and only get better from there<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, if my katana <em>doesn't</em> do extra damage, what's the point of Sacred Weapon for now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does give you a +1 enhancement bonus to your katana, which applies to attack rolls <em>and</em> damage rolls, and also means you don't need to go find a +1 katana, more or less. Also, at level 8 it will become a +2, and you can adjust that to get more interesting properties- you could either have a +2 to damage and to hit, or you could have a +1 <em>and</em> have your katana do 1d6 extra electric damage on a hit. Basically, you have 7 rounds where you can really eke out more.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>You get 2 + INT mod skill points per level. You get a +3 to any skills that we ticked off with an X, which I think is already accounted for; it doesn't look like you receive any special skills from your Deity.</p>
<h2 id="my-read-on-warpriest-design">My read on Warpriest Design</h2>
<p>It seems like Warpriests are designed to be martials first who can easily self buff and can be a back up healer. If whacking people with a holy sword is what you're going for, this seems solid.</p>
